# Instructions on how to run the application locally.
- Firstly, we need Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Need to install MongoDB on our machine.
- We also need to connect local database on MongoDB compass
- Need to initialize npm by command: npm init -y
- Configure database, express, typescript, as necessary steps & also need to set tsconfig.json, package.json file etc.
- Lastly, open terminal build our typescript code into javascript code. Because, Node.js itself doesn't directly understand TypeScript; it only understands JavaScript. TypeScript needs to be transpiled into JavaScript before it can be run by Node.js.Then start our npm .
